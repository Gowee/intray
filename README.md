# InTray

InTray ðŸ“¥ is a lightweight and simplistic CLI tool with a clean Web UI to facilitate collecting files over HTTP.

Written in Rust and powered by the succinct web framework tide, InTray has reasonable performance and decent concurrency support. It provides nothing other than receiving upload, but with great convenience and reliability.

It can be an alternative to `python -m pyftpdlib`, even though it does not cover all usage scenarios of the latter.

## Install
`cargo install intray`

*TODO: Instructions on downloading from releases*
